# My-First-Blogpost
Today marks an exciting moment—I’m publishing my very first blog post! I decided to use GitHub as the platform to share my thoughts and projects. It’s a great way to learn version control and showcase work publicly.

A little about me: I’m currently a student at Berufskolleg Bergisch Gladbach (BKGL), a school that offers a wide range of educational programs and focuses on practical learning combined with theory. It’s a place where students can develop both technical and professional skills for the future.

This is my School

That’s it for now—just wanted to share this first step. More posts coming soon!
